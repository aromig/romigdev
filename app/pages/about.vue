    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I am a full-stack developer located in Dayton, Ohio, with years of
      various programming experience. I enjoy making web sites, applications,
      and scripts to make my team's and customers' lives easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began learning about programming from a young age, delicately typing
      BASIC and machine language code from
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/compute-magazine" target="_blank"
        >Compute!</a
      >
      magazines into my dad's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128" target="_blank"
        >Commodore 128</a
      >. From there I was learning QBasic, Pascal, and C++ in my teen years. I
      started writing HTML in the late 90's and kept a broad interest in web
      development throughout my adult life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have an Associate's Degree of Applied Business from the
      <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu/">University of Toledo</a>, majoring in
      Programming & Software Development, but a good portion of my current web
      development knowledge is self-taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I am making other things. I enjoy
      <a href="/recipes">cooking</a>
      and <a href="https://cakes.romig.dev/" target="_blank">baking</a>
      cakes for birthdays, special occasions or just for fun.
    </p>

    <h2>What I know</h2>
    <p>
      I have a range of skills that I have learned over my career, both out of
      necessity & curiousity:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client-side: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/ES6+</li>
      <li>Server-side: PHP, C#, and SQL</li>
      <li>
        Operational: Web servers, database structure, &amp; build tools (e.g.
        git, npm)
      </li>
      <li>Scripting: Bash, PowerShell, Python</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I also come from a support background so customer service, troubleshooting
      issues, coordinating logistics, and finding solutions are second nature to
      me.
    </p>

    <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently developing within the ServiceNow platform, working on my
      assigned service requests, incidents, and stories. There's something new
      to learn every day! I'm working on various integrations and service portal
      enhancements using features such as Flow Designer flows and scripted REST
      APIs.
    </p>
